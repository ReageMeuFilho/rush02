## About The Project

The main objective of this project is to create a program that takes an unsigned integer as input and outputs the corresponding English word representation. The program can also accept a custom dictionary to perform the conversion.

This project is designed to test your skills in:

* C programming
* Memory management (malloc, free)
* File I/O (open, read, close)
* String manipulation
* Error handling
* Teamwork and collaboration

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* A C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)
* `make` utility

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ReageMeuFilho/rush02.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```sh
   cd rush02
   ```
3. Compile the project
   ```sh
   make
   ```

## Usage

The program can be run in two ways:

1.  **With a single argument (the number to convert):**

    ```sh
    ./rush-02 <number>
    ```

    Example:

    ```sh
    ./rush-02 123
    # Expected output: one hundred twenty-three
    ```

2.  **With two arguments (a custom dictionary and the number to convert):**

    ```sh
    ./rush-02 <dictionary_file> <number>
    ```

    Example:

    ```sh
    ./rush-02 numbers.dict 42
    # Expected output: forty-two
    ```

## Error Handling

The program handles the following errors:

*   **Invalid Input:** If the input number is not a valid positive integer, the program will print `Error` followed by a newline.
*   **Dictionary Error:** If there is an issue with the dictionary file (e.g., parsing error, file not found, or the dictionary does not allow for the conversion of the given number), the program will print `Dict Error` followed by a newline.

## File Structure

The project is organized into the following files:

| File                      | Description                                                                 |

| `dict_free.c`             | Frees the memory allocated for the dictionary.                              |
| `dict_lookup.c`           | Looks up values in the dictionary.                                          |
| `digits_keys.c`           | Handles the logic for converting single digits to words.                    |
| `digits_triplet.c`        | Handles the logic for converting triplets of digits to words.               |
| `free_lines.c`            | Frees the memory allocated for the lines read from the dictionary file.     |
| `get_triplet.c`           | Extracts a triplet of digits from the input number.                         |

## Bonus Features

This project includes the following bonus features:

*   **Advanced Syntax:** The program can use hyphens (-), commas (,), and "and" to produce more grammatically correct output.
*   **Multi-language Support:** The program can use a different dictionary to convert numbers into other languages.
*   **Standard Input:** The program can read numbers from the standard input (one per line) if the number argument is `-`.

## Makefile

The `Makefile` includes the following rules:

*   `make` or `make all`: Compiles the project and creates the `rush-02` executable.
*   `make clean`: Removes the object files.
*   `make fclean`: Removes the object files and the `rush-02` executable.
*   `make re`: Recompiles the project.

## Submission and Evaluation

This project is submitted to the 42 intra git repository. The evaluation is done by peers and a final evaluation by the piscine staff. The project must adhere to the 42 coding standards (Norm).
